# Blockchain Project

This repository is based on the book "Learn Blockchain by Building One" by Daniel van Flymen.

How to install enviroment:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In general every folder is self-contained and present one concept of blockchain like Proof of Work or hashing.

The folder funcoin is the last project in which we simulate a coin build up a server, messages, handle connections, transactions, etc.

The book is quite short and is worth a try. It's fun to see some concepts come to life.
